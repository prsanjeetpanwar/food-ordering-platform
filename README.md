Overview
The Food Ordering Platform backend is designed to provide a seamless experience for customers, restaurant owners, and admins. The platform supports various features like:

User registration and authentication.
Menu management (CRUD operations for food items).
Order placement and tracking.
Admin control to manage orders and users.
This project uses Express.js for handling HTTP requests, TypeScript for type safety, and follows RESTful principles for API design.

Tech Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that provides static types, making the code more reliable and easier to maintain.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to simplify API creation.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure authentication and authorization.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
dotenv: For environment variable management.
Features
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
Food Menu Management: Admins can add, update, or remove food items from the menu.
Order Management: Users can place orders, track their status, and view previous orders.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can view and manage orders, user data, and more.
JWT Authentication: Secured API endpoints with JWT tokens for user authentication.
Error Handling: Global error handling for better debugging and user experience.
